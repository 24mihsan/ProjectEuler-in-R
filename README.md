# ProjectEuler-in-R
This is my repository to showcase my two skills: programming in R and Project Euler problem solving. I will display my R scripts used to answer problems 1 to 100.

Disclaimer: "... the rule about sharing solutions outside of Project Euler does not apply to the first one-hundred problems ... and if you are able to respect our requirements, then we give permission for those problems and their solutions to be discussed elsewhere."

Remarks:
1. The scripts have been tested to output the answers in under one minute as recommended. Altering the inputs may change the running time significantly
2. The scripts were developed on the first attempt and may not be the most efficient approach. This is fine because the best solution will be discussed in .pdf once the problem is solved; however, disclosing the .pdf is prohibited. Thus I will not disclose the best approach to any problem in this repository.
3. Efforts are made to ensure that library imports are not required (and strictly avoided!); however, some common operators (numeric operators, string operators, etc) are not available at the start and needs to import from relevant libraries
